\item Let x, y, z be three positive reals such that xyz $ \geq 1$. Prove that
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^5-x^2}{x^5 + y^2 + z^2}+\frac{y^5-y^2}{x^2 + y^5 + z^2}+\frac{z^5-z^2}{x^2 + y^2 + z^5}\geq 0
\end{align*}

\item Let $a_1, a_2,$....... be a sequence of integers with infinitely many positive and negative terms. Suppose that for every positive integer n the
numbers $a_1, a_2,........, a_n$ leave n different remainders upon division by n.
Prove that every integer occurs exactly once in the sequence $a_1, a_2,$.......

\item Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the infinite sequence
\begin{align*}
a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^{n}-1, n\geq 1.
\end{align*}
