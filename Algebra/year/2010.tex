\item Let $a_1, a_2, a_3,.......$ be a sequence of positive real numbers. Suppose that for some positive integer s, we have 
\begin{align*}
a_n = max\{a_k + a_{n-k} | 1 \leq k \leq n - 1\}
\end{align*}
for all $n > s$. Prove that there exist positive integers l and N, with $l\leq s$ and such that  $a_n = a_l+a_{n - l}$ for all $n \leq N$.
