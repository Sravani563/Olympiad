\item Find all integers n $\geq$ 3 for which there exist real numbers $a_1, a_2,$ . . . , $a_n+2$, such that 
$a_{n + 1} = a_1$ and $a_{n + 2} = a_2$, and $a_ia_{i + 1} + 1 = a_{i + 2}$ for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

\item Let $a_1,a_2$, . . . be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Suppose that there is an
integer N $>$ 1 such that, for each n $\geq$ N, the number
\begin{align*}
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3}+.....+\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}+\frac{a_n}{a_1}
\end{align*}
is an integer. Prove that there is a positive integer M such that$a_m = a_{m+1}$ for all m $\geq$ M.
