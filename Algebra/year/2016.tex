\item A set of positive integers is called fragrant if it contains at least two elements and each of its elements has a prime factor in common with at least one of the other elements.Let P(n) = $n^2 + n + 1$
what is the least possible value of the positive integer b such that there exists a non-negative integer a for which the set\\
$\{P(a+1),P(a+2),...,P(a+b)\}$\\
is fragrant?
