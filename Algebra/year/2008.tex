\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^{2}}{(x - 1)^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{(y - 1)^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{(z - 1)^{2}}\geq1
\end{align*}
for all real numbers x, y, z, each different from 1, and satisfying xyz = 1.
\item Prove that equality holds above for infinitely many triples of rational numbers x, y, z, each different from 1, and satisfying xyz = 1.
\end{enumerate} 

\item Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that $n^{2} + 1$ has a prime divisor which is greater than $2n + \sqrt{2n}$.

\item Let n and k be positive integers with k $\geq$ n and k - n an even number. Let 2n lamps labelled 1, 2,....., 2n be given, each of which can be either on or off. Initially all the lamps are off. We consider sequences of steps: at each step one of the lamps is switched (from on to off or from off to on).
Let N be the number of such sequences consisting of k steps and resulting in the state where lamps 1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all off.
Let M be the number of such sequences consisting of k steps, resulting in the state where lamps 1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all off, but where none of the lamps n + 1 through 2n is ever switched on.
Determine the ratio $\frac{N}{M}$.
