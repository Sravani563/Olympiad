\item We say that a finite set S of the point in the plane is balanced if,for any two different points A and B in S,there is a point C in S such that AC=BC.We say that S is centre-free if for any three different point A,B,C in S,there is no point P in S such that PA=PB=PC.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that for all integers n $\geq$ 3,there exist a balanced set consisting of n points.
\item Determine all integers n $\geq$ 3 for which there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of n points.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let R be the set of Real numbers.Determine all functions f:R $\rightarrow$ R satisfying the equation
\begin{align*}
f(x+f(x+y))+f(xy)=x+f(x+y)+yf(x)
\end{align*}
for all real numbers x and y.
