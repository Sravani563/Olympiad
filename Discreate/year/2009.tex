\item Suppose that $s_1, s_2, s_3, . . .$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that the sub sequences $s_{s_1}, s_{s_2}, s_{s_3},.......$ and $s_{s_1+1}, s_{s_2+1}, s_{s_3+1}, . . .$ are both arithmetic progressions. Prove that the sequence $s_1, s_2, s_3,.......$is itself an arithmetic progression.

\item Determine all functions f from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers such that, for all positive integers a and b, there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths
a, f(b) and f(b + f(a)-1).\\
(A triangle is non-degenerate if its vertices are not collinear.)
