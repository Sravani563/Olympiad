\item Determine the least real number M such that the inequality
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix} ab(a^2-b^2) + bc(b^2-c^2) + ca(c^2-a^2) \end{vmatrix} \leq M(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2
\end{align*}
holds for all real numbers a, b and c.

\item Determine all pairs (x, y) of integers such that
$1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2.$

\item Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n $>$ 1 with integer coefficients and let
k be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial Q(x) = P (P (. . . P (P (x)) . . .)), where P
occurs k times. Prove that there are at most n integers t such that Q(t) = t.
