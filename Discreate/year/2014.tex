\item Let n $\geq$ 2 be an integer. Consider an n $\times$ n chessboard consisting of $n^2$ unit squares.A configuration of n rooks on this board is peaceful if every row and every column contains exactly one rook. Find the greatest positive integer k such that, for each peaceful configuration of n rooks,there is a 
k $\times$ k square which does not contain a rook on any of its $k^2$ unit squares.

\item For each positive integer n, the Bank of Cape Town issues coins of denomination $\frac{1}{n}$.Given a finite collection of such coins (of not necessarily different denominations) with total value at most
 $99 +\frac{1}{2}$, prove that it is possible to split this collection into 100 or fewer groups, such that each group has total value at most 1.

\item A set of lines in the plane is in general position if no two are parallel and no three pass through the same point. A set of lines in general position cuts the plane into regions, some of which have finite area; we call these its finite regions. Prove that for all sufficiently large n, in any set of n lines in general position it is possible to colour at least $\sqrt{n}$ of the lines blue in such a way that none of its finite regions has a completely blue boundary.
