\item The liarâ€™s guessing game is a game played between two players A and B. The rules of the game depend on two positive integers k and n which are known to both players.At the start of the game A chooses integers x and N with 1 $\leq$x $\leq$ N. Player A keeps x secret,and truthfully tells N to player B. Player B now tries to obtain information about x by asking player A questions as follows: each question consists of B specifying an arbitrary set S of positive integers (possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking A whether x belongs to S. Player B may ask as many such questions as he wishes. After each question, player A must immediately answer it with yes or no, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants; the only restriction is that, among any k + 1 consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful.After B has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set X of at most n positive integers. If x belongs to X, then B wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If n $\leq 2^k$, then B can guarantee a win.
\item For all sufficiently large k, there exists an integer $n \leq 1.99^k$ such that B cannot guarantee a win.
\end{enumerate}

\item Find all functions f : Z $\rightarrow$ Z such that, for all integers a, b, c that satisfy a + b + c = 0,the following equality holds:
\begin{align*}
f(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(c)^2 = 2f(a)f(b) + 2f(b)f(c) + 2f(c)f(a).
\end{align*}
(Here Z denotes the set of integers.)
