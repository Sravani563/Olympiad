\item A configuration of 4027 points in the plane is called Colombian if it consists of 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, and no three of the points of the configuration are collinear. By drawing some lines, the plane is divided into several regions. An arrangement of lines is good for a Colombian configuration if the following two conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item no line passes through any point of the configuration;
\item no region contains points of both colours.
\end{enumerate}
Find the least value of k such that for any Colombian configuration of 4027 points, there is a good arrangement of k lines.

\item Let n $\geq$ 3 be an integer, and consider a circle with n + 1 equally spaced points marked on it. Consider all labellings of these points with the numbers 0, 1, . . . , n such that each label is used exactly once; two such labellings are considered to be the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation of the circle. A labelling is called beautiful if, for any four labels a $<$ b $<$ c $<$ d with a + d = b + c, the chord joining the points labelled a and d does not intersect the chord joining the points labelled b and c.
Let M be the number of beautiful labellings, and let N be the number of ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers such that x + y $\leq$ n and gcd(x, y) = 1. Prove that M = N + 1.
