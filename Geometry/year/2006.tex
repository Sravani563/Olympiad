\item Let ABC be a triangle with incentre I. A point P in the interior of the
triangle satisfies
\begin{align*}
\angle PBA + \angle PCA = \angle PBC + \angle PCB.
\end{align*}
Show that AP $\geq$ AI, and that equality holds if and only if P = I.

\item Let P be a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal of P is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of P into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of P .The sides of P are also called good.
Suppose P has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of P . Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.

\item Assign to each side b of a convex polygon P the maximum area of a triangle that has b as a side and is contained in P . Show that the sum of the areas assigned to the sides of P is at least twice the area of P.
