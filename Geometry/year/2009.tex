\item Let ABC be a triangle with circumcentre O. The points P and Q are interior points of the sides CA and AB, respectively. Let K, L and M be the midpoints of the segments BP, CQ and PQ, respectively, and let $\Gamma$ be the circle passing through K, L and M. Suppose that the line PQ is tangent to the circle $\Gamma$. Prove that OP = OQ.

\item Let ABC be a triangle with AB = AC. The angle bisectors of $\angle$ CAB and $\angle$ ABC meet the sides BC and CA at D and E, respectively. Let K be the in centre of triangle ADC.Suppose that $\angle$BEK = $45^{o}$. Find all possible values of $\angle$ CAB.
