\item Let I be the incentre of triangle ABC and let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle. Let the line AI intersect
$\Gamma$ again at D. Let E be a point on the arc BDC and F a point on the side BC such that
\begin{align*}
\angle BAF = \angle CAE <\frac{1}{2}\angle BAC.
\end{align*}
Finally, let G be the midpoint of the segment IF. Prove that the lines DG and EI intersect on $\Gamma$.

\item Let P be a point inside the triangle ABC. The lines AP , BP and CP intersect the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle ABC again at the points K, L and M respectively. The tangent to $\Gamma$ at C intersects the line AB at S. Suppose that SC = SP . Prove that MK = ML.
