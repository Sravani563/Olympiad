\item Given triangle ABC the point J is the centre of the excircle opposite the vertex A.This excircle is tangent to the side BC at M, and to the lines AB and AC at K and L, respectively.The lines LM and BJ meet at F, and the lines KM and CJ meet at G. Let S be the point of intersection of the lines AF and BC, and let T be the point of intersection of the lines AG and BC.Prove that M is the midpoint of ST.
(The excircle of ABC opposite the vertex A is the circle that is tangent to the line segment BC,to the ray AB beyond B, and to the ray AC beyond C.)

\item Let ABC be a triangle with $\angle$BCA = $90^{o}$, and let D be the foot of the altitude from C. Let X be a point in the interior of the segment CD. Let K be the point on the segment AX such that BK = BC. Similarly, let L be the point on the segment BX such that AL = AC. Let M be the point of intersection of AL and BK.Show that MK = ML.
