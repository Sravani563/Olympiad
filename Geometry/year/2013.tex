\item Let the excircle of triangle ABC opposite the vertex A be tangent to the side BC at the point $A_1$. Define the points $B_1$ on CA and $C_1$ on AB analogously, using the excircles opposite B and C, respectively. Suppose that the circumcentre of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Prove that triangle ABC is right-angled.The excircle of triangle ABC opposite the vertex A is the circle that is tangent to the line segment BC, to the ray AB beyond B, and to the ray AC beyond C. The excircles opposite B and C are similarly defined.

\item Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with orthocentre H, and let W be a point on the side BC, lying strictly between B and C. The points M and N are the feet of the altitudes from B and C, respectively. Denote by $\omega_1$ the circumcircle of BWN, and let X be the point on $\omega_1$ such that WX is a diameter of $\omega_1$. Analogously, denote by $\omega_2$ the circumcircle of CWM, and let Y be the point on $\omega_2$ such that WY is a diameter of $\omega_2$. Prove that X, Y and H are collinear.
