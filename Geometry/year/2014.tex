\item Convex quadri lateral ABCD has $\angle$ABC = $\angle$CDA = $90^{o}$. Point H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BD. Points S and T lie on sides AB and AD, respectively, such that H lies inside triangle SCT and
\begin{align*}
\angle CHS - \angle CSB = 90^{o}, \angle THC - \angle DTC = 90^{o}
\end{align*}
Prove that line BD is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle TSH.

\item Points P and Q lie on side BC of acute-angled triangle ABC so that $\angle$PAB = $\angle$BCA and $\angle$CAQ = $\angle$ ABC. Points M and N lie on lines AP and AQ, respectively, such that P is the midpoint of AM, and Q is the midpoint of AN. Prove that lines BM and CN intersect on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.
