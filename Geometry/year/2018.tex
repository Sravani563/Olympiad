\item Let $\Gamma$be the circumcircle of acute-angled triangle ABC. Points D and E lie on segments AB and AC, respectively, such that AD = AE. The perpendicular bisectors of BD and
CE intersect the minor arcs AB and AC of $\Gamma$ at points F and G, respectively. Prove that the lines DE and FG are parallel (or are the same line).

\item A convex quadrilateral ABCD satisfies AB·CD = BC·DA. Point X lies inside
ABCD so that $\angle$XAB = $\angle$XCD and $\angle$XBC = $\angle$XDA.\\
Prove that $\angle$BXA + $\angle$DXC = $180^{o}$.
