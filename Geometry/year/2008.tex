\item An acute-angled triangle ABC has orthocentre H. The circle passing through H with centre the midpoint of BC intersects the line BC at $A_1 and A_2$. Similarly, the circle passing through H with centre the midpoint of CA intersects the line CA at $B_1 and B_2$, and the circle passing through H with centre the midpoint of AB intersects the line AB at $C_1 and C_2$. Show that $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2,
C_1, C_2$ lie on a circle.

\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with $\begin{vmatrix} BA \end{vmatrix} \neq \begin{vmatrix} BC \end{vmatrix}$. Denote the in circles of triangles ABC and ADC by $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ respectively. Suppose that there exists a circle $\omega$ tangent to the ray BA beyond A and to the ray BC beyond C, which is also tangent to the lines AD and CD.Prove that the common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect on $\omega$.
