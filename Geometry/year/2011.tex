\item Let ABC be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let l be a tangent line to $\Gamma$, and let $l_a,l_b$ and $l_c$ be the lines obtained by reflecting l in the lines BC, CA and AB, respectively. Show that the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines $l_a,l_b$ and $l_c$  is tangent to the circle $\Gamma$.
