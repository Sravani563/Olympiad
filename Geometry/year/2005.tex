\item Six points are chosen on the sides of an equilateral triangle ABC: $A_1, A_2$ on BC, $B_1, B_2$ on CA and $C_1, C_2$ on AB, such that they are the vertices of a convex hexagon $A_1A_2B_1B_2C_1C_2$ with equal side lengths. Prove that the lines $A_1 B_2, B_1 C_2$ and $C_1 A_2$ are concurrent.

\item Let ABCD be a fixed convex quadrilateral with BC = DA and BC not parallel with DA. Let two variable points E and F lie of the sides BC and DA, respectively and satisfy BE = DF. The lines AC and BD meet at P, the lines BD and EF meet at Q, the lines EF and AC meet at R.
Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles PQR, as E and F vary, have a common point other than P.
