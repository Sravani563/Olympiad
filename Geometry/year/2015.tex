\item Let ABC be an acute triangle with AB $>$ AC.Let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle,H its orthocentre,and F the foot of the altitude from A.Let M be the midpoint of BC.Let Q be the point on $\Gamma$ suchn that $\angle$HQA=90,and let K be the point on $\Gamma$ such that $\angle$HKQ=90.Assume that the point A,B,C,K and Q are all different,and lie on $\Gamma$ in this order.
Prove that the circumcircle of triangle KQH and FKM are tangent to each other.

\item Triangle ABC has cicumcircle $\Omega$ and circumcenter O.A circle $\Gamma$ with centre A intersects the segment BC at point D and E,such that B,D,E and C are all different and lie on the line BC in this order .Let F and G be the points of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$,such that A,F,B,C and G lie on $\Omega$ in this order.Let K be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of the triangle BDF and segment AB.Let L be the second point of intersection of circumcircle of triangle CGE and the segment CA.
Suppose that lines FK and Gl are different and intersects at the point X.Prove that X lies on the line AO.
